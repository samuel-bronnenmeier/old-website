### General
Here is my website.
You can clearly see it is not finished yet.

The "Home" is pretty good now (I think so at least).

"Projects" will come but you must have a little bit of patience.

"Downloads" is kind of finished but I tried to keep them as axpandable as possible.

What shall I do about "About"?

##### Home
Icons from fontawesome-free-5.15.3-web

### Project Status
"Home" is sort of finished.
There is only one lethal aspect missing: content.

Same with "Downloads".
